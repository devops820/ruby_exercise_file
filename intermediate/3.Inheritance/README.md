# Inheritance

Behaviours, methods, attributes are passed down.

Subclasses Override and extend behaviours of the parent class.

Techniques for accessing superclass from subclass.

- You can call methods inherited from parent
- You can call parent methods even after overriding them
- Perform additional code before and/or after a parent method
- Fall back to a parent method if the condition is not met.
- Can assign the return value of super to a variable
- Can pass arguments to super if parent class accepts arguments
